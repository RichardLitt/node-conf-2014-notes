Here's the reference solution:

  console.log('BEEP BOOP');

We piped the output of browserify into the verify command directly, but
ordinarily to use browserify in your page you would do:

  browserify beep_boop.js > bundle.js

and then in your html, you just add a single <script> tag:

  <script src="bundle.js"></script>

We'll be doing this for real in some of the later challenges.
