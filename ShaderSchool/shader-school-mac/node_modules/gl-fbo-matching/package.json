There are certainly smarter ways of doing this but this\nis the simplest :)\n\n## Usage\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gl-fbo-matching.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/gl-fbo-matching/)\n\n### channels = matching(fbo1, fbo2, [threshold])\n\nReturns an array of values: one for each channel (RGBA). A value of 1 means that\nall of the pixels in `fbo1` match those in `fbo2`, and a value of 0 means that\nnone of them do.\n\nOptionally, you can pass in a `threshold` value to limit the comparison's\nsensitivity â€“ effectively, setting the maximum distance between two pixels'\nvalues before considering that pixel matching. Defaults to 0.\n\nNote that using this function will result in\n`gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, null)` being called.\n\n## License\n\nMIT. See [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/hughsk/gl-fbo-matching/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
